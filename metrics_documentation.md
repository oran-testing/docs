## Singleton Metrics
These metrics are independent of specific carriers and provide system-wide or UE-wide information.

### Metrics

- **`rf_o`**: RF front-end overflows. Indicates how many times the RF front-end buffer overflowed.
- **`rf_u`**: RF front-end underflows. Indicates how many times the RF front-end buffer underflowed.
- **`rf_l`**: RF front-end late samples. Indicates the number of late samples received by the RF front-end.

- **`nof_active_cc`**: Number of active component carriers. The maximum of LTE and NR active component carriers.

- **`dl_tput_mbps`**: Downlink throughput in Mbps. Measures the data rate received by the UE.
- **`ul_tput_mbps`**: Uplink throughput in Mbps. Measures the data rate transmitted by the UE.

- **`ul_dropped_sdus`**: Number of uplink SDUs (Service Data Units) dropped by the stack.
- **`nof_active_eps_bearer`**: Number of active EPS (Evolved Packet System) bearers.
- **`emm_state`**: EMM (EPS Mobility Management) state. Reflects the current state of the UE in the EMM state machine.

- **`proc_rmem`**: Real memory usage of the process in bytes.
- **`proc_rmem_kB`**: Real memory usage of the process in kilobytes.
- **`proc_vmem_kB`**: Virtual memory usage of the process in kilobytes.
- **`sys_mem`**: Total system memory usage in bytes.
- **`system_load`**: CPU usage of the process as a percentage of the total CPU.

## Carrier-Specific Metrics
These metrics are collected for each active carrier, including both LTE and NR carriers. The carrier type (LTE or NR) and channel index are specified.

### Metrics

- **`dl_earfcn`**: Downlink EARFCN (E-UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number). Indicates the frequency used by the carrier.
- **`pci`**: Physical Cell ID. Identifies the cell from which the signal is received.

- **`rsrp`**: Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP). Measures the power level of the reference signal.
- **`pathloss`**: Path loss. Represents the loss of signal power due to propagation.
- **`cfo`**: Carrier frequency offset. Indicates the frequency offset between the received signal and the expected carrier frequency.

- **`rl_mcs`**: Uplink modulation and coding scheme (MCS).
- **`dl_mcs`**: Downlink modulation and coding scheme (MCS).
- **`sinr`**: Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR). Represents the quality of the signal. If infinite, it is set to `0`.
- **`fec_iters`**: Number of forward error correction (FEC) iterations performed.

- **`rx_brate`**: Received bit rate in Kbps. Computed as the average bit rate over the number of TTI (Transmission Time Intervals).
- **`tx_brate`**: Transmitted bit rate in Kbps. Computed as the average bit rate over the number of TTIs.

- **`rx_pkts`**: Total number of received packets.
- **`rx_errors`**: Total number of receive errors.
- **`tx_pkts`**: Total number of transmitted packets.
- **`tx_errors`**: Total number of transmit errors.

- **`ta_us`**: Timing advance in microseconds. Represents the time alignment between the UE and eNodeB/gNodeB.
- **`distance_km`**: Estimated distance to the cell in kilometers.
- **`speed_kmph`**: Speed of the UE in kilometers per hour.
- **`ul_buffer`**: Size of the uplink buffer in bytes.

- **`rrc_state`**: RRC (Radio Resource Control) state. Indicates the current state of the RRC state machine.

## Notes
- Metrics are posted to the InfluxDB server using the HTTP API.
- Errors returned from InfluxDB are logged to the console.
- The timestamp for each metric is derived from the systemâ€™s epoch time in nanoseconds.

### Improvements and Future Work
- Neighboring cell metrics (e.g., neighbor cell RSRP) can be added in the future.
- Metrics differentiation for multiple UEs should be implemented.
