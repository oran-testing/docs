Quickstart 
==========

Machine and OS Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RAN tester UE is tested on ``Ubuntu 24.04``. However, any linux
distro or MacOS machine should be able to run the software with few
issues. If there are problems on these platforms, feel free to make an
issue for us to address.

We recommend using the ubuntu realtime kernel, which is available for
purchase from canonical. Alternatively, use can use the lowlatency
kernel, which is free.

A powerful machine is recommended, since many of the attacks are
resource intensive.

Required Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the following on your system before running the system: 

- docker engine 
- docker compose 
- UHD utilites (for downloading firmware images)

Running a Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**First, clone the core repository**

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/oran-testing/ran-tester-ue.git

**Navigate to the directory and run the system setup script:**

.. code:: bash

   cd ran-tester-ue
   ./scripts/system_setup.sh

**Now, pull the system containers from our registry:**

.. code:: bash

   sudo docker compose pull      # Grafana, InfluxDB, and Controller

Alternatively, you can build the images yourself:

.. code:: bash

   sudo docker compose build

**Finally, modify the configuration to run a test:**

The test specification is defined in the YAML config
(``ran-tester-ue/spec.yaml``):

This configuration tells the controller which services to run, and in
what order. This allows for fully automated tests with many components.

.. code:: yaml

   enable_cli: true

   build_spec:
     - component: "sni5gect"
       docker_image: "ghcr.io/oran-testing/sni5gect"
       pull: false

   run_spec:
     - component: "rtue"
       name: "rtue_uhd_1"
       config_file: "configs/srsran/ue_uhd.conf"
       rf:
         type: "b200"
     - component: "sni5gect"
       name: "downlink_sniffer"
       config_file: "configs/sni5gect/srsgnb_band3.yaml"
       rf:
         type: "b200"

The above configuration will run a sni5gect sniffer and UE with the
requested environment, writing all data to influxdb and displaying
metrics in realtime with grafana.

To start the system run:

.. code:: bash

   sudo docker compose up

The Grafana dashboard can be accessed at http://localhost:3300.
