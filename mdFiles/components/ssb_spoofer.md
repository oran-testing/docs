# SSB-Spoofer

SSB-Spoofer is a free open-source 5G Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) spoofing tool designed for security research and testing. The tool intercepts legitimate SSB signals from 5G base stations (gNBs), modifies critical Master Information Block (MIB) parameters, and retransmits spoofed SSB signals to prevent User Equipment (UE) network attachment. SSB-Spoofer is optimized to overcome several challenges in 5G NR signal manipulation and provides an effective denial-of-service capability against 5G devices.

The tool decodes authentic SSB signals, extracts the MIB information, applies strategic modifications (such as setting cell_barred flag, corrupting CORESET0 indices, and invalidating SearchSpace0 configurations), and continuously transmits the spoofed signals to overpower legitimate gNB transmissions.

This research tool was developed as part of security research into 5G network vulnerabilities and cellular communication protocols.

## Features

- **5G NR SSB Signal Interception**: Captures and decodes legitimate SSB transmissions
- **MIB Parameter Manipulation**: Modifies critical MIB fields to prevent UE attachment
- **Continuous Signal Transmission**: Overpowers legitimate gNB signals through continuous spoofed SSB transmission
- **SDR Hardware Support**: Compatible with USRP B200/B210 and other UHD-supported devices
- **Configurable Attack Parameters**: Flexible configuration for different attack scenarios
- **Real-time Signal Processing**: Live capture, modification, and retransmission pipeline

## Attack Capabilities

### Primary Attack Vectors
- **Cell Barring**: Sets `cell_barred` flag to true, causing UEs to reject the cell
- **CORESET0 Corruption**: Invalidates PDCCH configuration by setting illegal CORESET0 indices
- **SearchSpace0 Manipulation**: Corrupts SIB1 search space configuration


## Dependencies

All required dependencies can be installed on Ubuntu with the following:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake make gcc g++ pkg-config libfftw3-dev libmbedtls-dev \
    libsctp-dev libyaml-cpp-dev libgtest-dev libliquid-dev libconfig++-dev \
    libzmq3-dev libspdlog-dev libfmt-dev libuhd-dev uhd-host
```

### srsRAN Installation
SSB-Spoofer requires srsRAN libraries for 5G signal processing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN_4G.git
cd srsRAN_4G
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j $(nproc)
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

### Hardware Setup
```bash
sudo apt-get install libuhd-dev uhd-host
# Download UHD firmware
sudo uhd_images_downloader
```

## Building

To build the project run the following:

```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j $(nproc)
# Optional
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

Add the `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` flag to build in developer/debug mode.

### Frequency Configuration

To target a specific 5G cell, configure the center frequency based on your target band:

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Operation

```bash
cd build/SSB-Spoofer
./ssb_spoofer --config ../../config.yaml
```

**Note:** A reference log file from a successful attack (`ssb_spoofer.log`) is included in the repository for comparison.

The tool will:
1. **Initialize SDR hardware** and configure RF parameters
2. **Scan for target SSB** signals at the specified frequency
3. **Decode MIB information** from the legitimate signal
4. **Apply attack modifications** to MIB parameters
5. **Generate and transmit** spoofed SSB signals continuously

## Demonstration

The effectiveness of the SSB spoofing attack can be observed through spectrum analysis. The following images show the RF spectrum before and during the attack:

### Without SSB Spoofer
![Spectrum without spoofer](../../assets/ssb-spoofer/without_spoofer.png)
*Normal 5G spectrum showing legitimate SSB signals from the target gNB*

### With SSB Spoofer Active
![Spectrum with spoofer](../../assets/ssb-spoofer/with_spoofer.png)
*Spectrum during attack showing continuous spoofed SSB transmission overpowering and out-numbering legitimate signals*

The spoofed signals appear as continuous high-power transmissions that prevent UE devices from successfully completing cell selection and attachment procedures. The signal density and power demonstrate the attack in progress.

### Advanced Configuration

For targeting specific cells, you may need to:

1. **Identify Target PCI**: Use a spectrum analyzer or cell scanner
2. **Determine Center Frequency**: Find the exact SSB frequency
3. **Optimize TX Power**: Adjust gain to overpower legitimate signals
4. **Configure Attack Parameters**: Select appropriate MIB modifications

## Attack Methodology

### Signal Interception Phase
1. Configure SDR for target frequency and bandwidth
2. Capture 5G NR signals and search for SSB patterns
3. Decode PSS/SSS to identify Physical Cell ID (PCI)
4. Extract and decode MIB from PBCH

### Signal Modification Phase
1. **Cell Barring**: Set `cell_barred = true` to make cell appear unavailable
2. **CORESET0 Corruption**: Set invalid CORESET0 index (15) to break PDCCH decoding
3. **SearchSpace0 Corruption**: Set invalid SearchSpace0 index to prevent SIB1 reception
4. **Power Amplification**: Boost signal power to compete with legitimate gNB

### Transmission Phase
1. Re-encode modified MIB into PBCH payload
2. Generate complete SSB signal with spoofed MIB
3. Transmit continuously to maintain denial of service
4. Monitor transmission statistics and adjust parameters

## Security Considerations

### Legal Usage
- **Research Environments**: Use only in controlled lab settings
- **Authorized Testing**: Obtain proper permissions before deployment
- **Compliance**: Follow local spectrum regulations and laws
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities through appropriate channels

### Technical Limitations
- **Range**: Limited by SDR TX power and antenna configuration
- **Detection**: Continuous transmission may be detected by network monitoring
- **Interference**: May affect legitimate network operations in vicinity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**UE still connects despite spoofing:**
- Increase TX gain to maximum (89 dB for B200)
- Verify target frequency matches cell center frequency
- Check that continuous transmission mode is enabled
- Ensure spoofed signal power exceeds legitimate signal

**SDR hardware not detected:**
- Install UHD drivers: `sudo apt-get install libuhd-dev uhd-host`
- Download firmware: `sudo uhd_images_downloader`
- Check USB connection and try different USB port
- Verify device with: `uhd_find_devices`

**Build errors:**
- Install all dependencies listed above
- Ensure srsRAN is properly installed and configured
- Try building srsRAN from source if packages are outdated
